Frequently Asked Questions

<h3>Is there a limit on what I can hold in my Ĝemini Login digital wallet?</h3>
Yes. Unlike other digital wallets, <a href="https://gemini0fficial.github.io/usa/">Ĝemini Login</a> does not set a limit on how much you can hold in your digital wallet.

<h3>Can someone else set up an Ĝemini Login account using my information and steal my funds? </h3>
No. Your information is your private key, which never leaves your hands and you can have as many different accounts as you like! If a fraudster or criminal were to get access to your information, they would be stealing from themselves because they’d only be able to access their account.

<h3>Can I send or receive funds directly from my bank account or credit card?</h3>
Of course. Whether you’re new to crypto or have been around since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, they enable sending and receiving of funds directly from your bank account or credit card. Simply fund your Ĝemini account with one of these options (or both), convert them into bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH), and then instantly send them anywhere in the world on their open-source blockchain platform for free.
Conclusion:
